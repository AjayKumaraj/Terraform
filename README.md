# Terraform Project README

A practical, production-ready template for Terraform repositories. Copy this file as `README.md` in your repo and adapt sections to your stack.

## Overview

This project uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to provision and manage infrastructure as code (IaC). It follows a modular structure, pins provider versions for reproducibility, and uses a remote backend for shared state.

---

## Prerequisites

* Terraform ≥ 1.3 (check with `terraform version`)
* Access credentials for your cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
* Remote state backend (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB, Azure Storage, GCS)
* Git & a CI system (optional but recommended)

> **Security**: Never commit secrets. Use environment variables, secret stores (e.g., AWS SSM, Azure Key Vault), or CI secrets.
